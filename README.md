## 🚀 Overview

This website serves as the primary gateway for MowisAI, explaining the core problems with current agent frameworks (direct OS access, lack of isolation) and presenting the MowisAI runtime solution (Sandbox, Brain/Hands model, Governance Laws).

It is built as a highly responsive Single Page Application (SPA) with a premium "Glassmorphism" aesthetic.

*   **Smooth Animations**: Orchestrated entrance animations using `framer-motion`.

    *   **Problem**: In-depth analysis of current agent security gaps.
    *   **Specification**: Full markdown rendering of the v0.1 Design Doc with **live Mermaid charts**.
    *   **Contact**: Minimalist contact gateway.
*   **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first architecture with adaptive layouts and navigation.
